            <h2>Growing Up</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Zionsville, Indiana, about an hour north of Indianapolis. I attended Zionsville Community High School, where I ran cross country and long-distance track for several years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the later years of high school I performed in a variety of stage-work, both through our nationally ranked Show Choirs and Musicals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started college in Biochemistry, with the goal to eventually get into medicinal research. It only took a semester for me to realize higher-education hard sciences were not for me. From there I took "Introduction to Informatics" and fell in love with the world of tech. I changed my major and jumped into my studies into Informatics.
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I tend to gravitate towards more creative hobbies and ventures! I'm big into Dungeons and Dragons, hosting games for friends weekly, reading and watching all forms of fantasy and fiction, and creating gadgets for fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a technical level, I love creative and boundary pushing personal projects where I can teach myself new skills and ideas. I love game design, automation, and artificial intelligence (though mostly reading about the last one.)

    <!-- PERSONAL VALUES -->
    <section class="values">
        <h2>Personal Values & Inspriations</h2>
        <p>
            The things that drive me and shape how I view the world are stories most of all. Stories of justice, family, equity and equality, and most of all kindness.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is no surprise that what I value reflects those ideals almost perfectly. My inspirations come from progress and innovation, in making things better. This applies to the technical world, as very little can get me talking like new discoveries and creations, but to everything else as well. Progress is measured by the things we make, and the value we put on other's lives.
