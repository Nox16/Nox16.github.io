                This mobile app is based on the gig-economy and would help busy people find one off jobs that fit within their varied and ranging skill sets by accepting job postings by other users for small time work!

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Our project aim was to create an application that could help people, primarily college students, find quick, small jobs that fit their niche skills and allow them to earn money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our research, we found that most college students cannot balance a full work schedule and academic responsibilities without harming their physical and mental health. Students had too many full-time or part-time commitments to properly take care of themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed an app similar to other gig-economy jobs like Grubhub or DoorDash but focused on user-created jobs with expanded skills beyond delivery. Our design was focused on ease of use and created with the intent of having no learning curve or barrier of entry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our evaluations we focused on the flow of use and how intuitive the app was. We wanted the app to "feel" comfortable and easy to navigate to not add any unnecessary stress to users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately we found that the app had good flow and users had only occasionally confusion in their tests. We isolated the confusing elements and honed them to be more consistent.

                    Users can create an account and profile and set their skill sets and location preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can view jobs based on a variety of preferences, like 'Filtered Jobs', 'Matched Skill Jobs', 'Reoccurring Jobs', 'Saved jobs', and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can view job information and contact employers to schedule a time to complete the job using the app's calendar function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can create job postings with skill requirements, location, images, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can leave reviews for employers and for employees to help communication their experiences.

                This video demonstrates our design process steps and the how we narrowed in on our final iteration of the app.

                It covers the Medium-Fidelity Iteration, the Heuristic Walkthrough of the App, the High-Fidelity Iteration, our Usability Tests with Volunteer Users, and our Final High-Fidelity Iteration.
